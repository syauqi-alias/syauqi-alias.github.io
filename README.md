# About
Hi, my name is Syauqi Alias, but you can call me Syauqi. I studied engineering for 6 years. I spent the first 3 years at the German-Malaysian Institute studying for a Diploma in Industrial Electronic (Electronic & I.T). After that, I continued my studies for another 3 years at The University of Manchester, where I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Engineering in Electrical and Electronics.
