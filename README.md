# About Me
My name is Syauqi. Studied engineering for 6 years. Spent the first 3 years at the German-Malaysian Institute studying for a Diploma in Industrial Electronic (Electronic & I.T). After that, continued my studies for another 3 years at The University of Manchester, where I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Engineering in Electrical and Electronics.

An electronic hobbyist at heart and enjoy working on various projects to enhance my design skills and learn new things.

These are the areas I am interested in:
- Machine Learning (Psstt... not actually started anything related to this yet)
- Computer Vision (Same as above for this)
- Designing low-powered electronics
- Creating small form factor designs
