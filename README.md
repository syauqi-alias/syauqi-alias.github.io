# Welcome to my portfolio
Hello there lost soul, seems like you have stumbled upon greatness (this portfolio). This is my online portfolio where you can access information about my experience projects, and upcoming project plans. Give time for the page to load.

To find the information you need, simply use the sidebar navigation.

# About Me
My name is Syauqi. Studied engineering for 6 years. Spent the first 3 years at the German-Malaysian Institute studying for a Diploma in Industrial Electronic (Electronic & I.T). Afterwards, continued my studies for another 3 years at The University of Manchester, where I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Engineering in Electrical and Electronics. But I am more into electronics rather than electrical.

An electronic hobbyist at heart and enjoy working on various projects to enhance my design skills and learn new things.

These are the areas I am interested in:
- Machine Learning (Psstt... not actually started anything related to this yet)
- Computer Vision (Same as above for this)
- Designing low-powered electronics
- Creating small form factor designs

# Current Status
Currently working as an Electronic Engineer (Research Technician) at University College London as of September 2023.
