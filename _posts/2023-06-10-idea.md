# RVDR+ 
*Commencing July 2023*

This is my fourth PCB project in the making. Just a bunch of ideas that I could think of. 

Component to consider: 

- CM4 as main CPU
- Utilize PCIe for storage
- U-blox SARA-R5 series for LTE and GNSS connectivity (SIM card or E-SIM?)
- powered with battery, need utilized low-power design (power supply design) 
- Camera module for recording purposes
- Various sensors; temperature, motion, proximity, magnetometer
- Display with touch screen capability? (needed further research)

Software:
- Plate recognition (OpenCV and in C++)
- MQTT client

- [Mechanical Keyboard Prototype With V-USB & QMK](https://www.ghost7.com/mechanical-keyboard-prototype-with-v-usb-qmk/)
- [How to burn the Plaid keyboard bootloader using Arduino Nano](https://www.algorist.co.uk/post/how-to-burn-the-plaid-keyboard-bootloader-using-arduino-nano/)

The command for the avrdude: 
```
avrdude -c stk500v1 -P COM12 -p m32a -U flash:w:C:/Users/ucems09/qmk_firmware/coseyfannitutti_discipline_default.hex:i -v -b 19200
```
-c stk500v1  use stk500 version 1 as the programmer.
-P port value, for this it is COM12, can check Arduino IDE.
-p type of MCU, for this it is m32a for Atmega32A.
-u program to be flashed in hex format.
-v just more information in the CLI.
-b set the baudrate this is 19200, was burn by the arduino ISP, very important to set the baudrate.
