# FPGA KVM switch with Power Line Communication (PLC)

First project to get my foot into FPGAs world, this will probably take 3 years to achieve. But we are here for the long haul don't we? Aite here we go. 

FPGA: Xilinx Artix-7 <br>
PLC IC/Modem: MaxLinear 88LX5152 Wave-2 G.hn standard Digital Baseband (DBB) Processor <br>
Target bit rate: no idea really, brain capacity at it's max 

Buddy going to break my bank. That's all I got... To Be Continue in Dragon Ball Z...

**Battery Management System IC: TI BQ25895**

A charger pass-through battery charging IC, can charge and directing the power to the SBC simultaneously. Adding an USB 2.0 multiplexer can connect to a host device (i.e. laptop) transfer data while charging, smart innit?

**PSU Boost IC: TI TPS61022**

A constant boost IC that supply fixed voltage at 5.1V with 8A maximum which give enough head room to power the SBC at 4A and the NVMe drive. With 1.5MHz switching frequency means small footprint, will it create EMC problem down the line? Nobody knows ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ we'll find out soon how bad is my routing.

**Main storage: 250GB NVMe 2230**

Purely based on the CM5 IO carrier board. Opt for a higher clearance M.2 slot so that I can place the step down converter under NVMe drive, save some space. *Note to self; make sure the drive is only populated on one side*.

For a bike-computer, this prolly don't make sense at all. Literally designing a PDA device. Bet it wont last even an hour of operation. Heh, at least we learn by doing mistake don't we (。_。) [flashing through me eyes all the failed projects]

# RVDR+ 
*Commencing July 2023*

This is my fourth PCB project in the making. Just a bunch of ideas that I could think of. 

Component to consider: 

- CM4 as main CPU
- Utilize PCIe for storage
- U-blox SARA-R5 series for LTE and GNSS connectivity (SIM card or E-SIM?)
- powered with battery, need utilized low-power design (power supply design) 
- Camera module for recording purposes
- Various sensors; temperature, motion, proximity, magnetometer
- Display with touch screen capability? (needed further research)

Software:
- Plate recognition (OpenCV and in C++)
- MQTT client

Link for project build reference:

- [Mechanical Keyboard Prototype With V-USB & QMK](https://www.ghost7.com/mechanical-keyboard-prototype-with-v-usb-qmk/)
- [How to burn the Plaid keyboard bootloader using Arduino Nano](https://www.algorist.co.uk/post/how-to-burn-the-plaid-keyboard-bootloader-using-arduino-nano/)

The command for the avrdude: 
```
avrdude -c stk500v1 -P COM12 -p m32a -U flash:w:C:/Users/ucems09/qmk_firmware/coseyfannitutti_discipline_default.hex:i -v -b 19200
```
- ```-c stk500v1```  use stk500 version 1 as the programmer.
- ```-P COM12``` port value, for this it is COM12, can check Arduino IDE.
- ```-p m32a``` type of MCU, for this it is m32a for Atmega32A.
- ```-u flash:w:C:/Users/ucems09/qmk_firmware/coseyfannitutti_discipline_default.hex:i``` program to be flashed in hex format.
- ```-v``` just more information in the CLI.
- ```-b 19200``` set the baudrate this is 19200, was burn by the arduino ISP, very important to set the baudrate.
