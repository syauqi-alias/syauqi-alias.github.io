# RVDR+ 
*Commencing July 2023*

This is my fourth PCB project in the making. Just a bunch of ideas that I could think of. 

Component to consider: 

- CM4 as main CPU
- Utilize PCIe for storage
- U-blox SARA-R5 series for LTE and GNSS connectivity (SIM card or E-SIM?)
- powered with battery, need utilized low-power design (power supply design) 
- Camera module for recording purposes
- Various sensors; temperature, motion, proximity, magnetometer
- Display with touch screen capability? (needed further research)

Software:
- Plate recognition (OpenCV and in C++)
- MQTT client
