As an electronic hobbyist, I've had the pleasure of completing some pretty "cool" side projects and university/diploma projects. It is in reverse chronological order.
# RVDR V2.0
Completed in 2023

Road Vehicle Data Recorder (RVDR) second revision. It's a smaller version of the first version. Some key changes were made as follows:

- Replace the GNSS module with built-in GPS/GNSS antenna modules using u-blox CAM-M8 series (external antenna is optional).
- Replace multiple sensor ICs with a single TDK ICM-20948 9-Axis MEMS motion tracking (although this is actually a downgrade from the previous 10-DOF sensor).
- Reduced the size to match that of a Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Added an option at the back of the board to choose the communication protocol: UART, SPI or I2C.

# The Kenit Numpad
Meet "The Kenit" Numpad (I ran out of ideas about what to name it). This time I experiment with the KiCad "Round Track" plugin. Does it pose any practical benefit? probably not at all, but does it look cool? Definitely! (or I assume to believe).

# 1-ØªÙˆØ§Ù‡/â€ŽTuah-One
1-ØªÙˆØ§Ù‡â€Ž/Tuah-One! A Custom 75% Mechanical Keyboard Project (based on open source schematic)
Months of design and was put into production in April this year. and.... that's it. Chip shortage and the cost of producing such a small quantity is very... very... expensive.

I've tried to arrange the Diode Array in a manner that looks like a traditional Malay carving (ukiran tradisional Melayu). A repeated shape with slight differences but in a repeating arrangement. Yes, it doesn't look much but I tried.

"1-ØªÙˆØ§Ù‡â€Ž/Tuah-one" means "lucky one", well not exactly. With a quick Google translate "tuah" is "good luck", written in Jawi (Malay writing alphabet system before the Latin alphabet came). And also paired with pixelated "art" of "Hang Tuah" (a Laksmana/Admiral in 15th century Melaka; considered by the Malays to be one of history's greatest silat masters [Wikipedia]). Hang Tuah is wearing a traditional Malay headgear called "Tengkolok" or "Tanjak", thus the triangle looks (I tried :P).
