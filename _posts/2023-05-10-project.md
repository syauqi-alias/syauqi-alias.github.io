As an electronic hobbyist, I've had the pleasure of completing some pretty "cool" side projects and university/diploma projects. It is in reverse chronological order.

# Pico-BLDC-Controller

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Development-blue)](https://github.com/your-username/Pi-BLDC-Controller)

I'm designing a custom hotplate magnetic stirrer to integrate into our lab's [Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/) robot at the Manufacturing Future Lab, University College London.

As this is my first time designing motor control systems, particularly for a BLDC motor, I am using a half-bridge configuration to control the three-phase input.

I am quite nervous designing anything more than 5V. The motor we have in the lab to utilise is a [260W 30V/7A Maxon motor](https://www.maxongroup.com/en-gb/search?q=500266)

I am using a Raspberry Pi microcontroller, specifically the new [RP2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/) dual-core model running at 150 MHz, because its design is much simpler than that of the STM32 MCU. I‚Äôve come across many discussions that claim RP2350 is not ideal for controlling BLDC motors, particularly when it comes to reading the current output. It is considered "slow" in converting ADC values compared to the STM32. However, I plan to open-source the design entirely, and I hope that someone with expertise can utilize it and develop firmware to address this issue. [insert Jimmy Neutron big brain time]

For the pre-driver, I've chosen the [Texas Instrument DRV8350S](https://www.ti.com/product/DRV8353). This integrated circuit significantly reduces the component count and complexity of the design. I won't need to implement filtering, snubbers, or anything like that‚Äîjust the pre-driver and the MOSFET gate. *Mah brain is not build for complicated things* (XuX)

On the software side, I am implementing the simpleFOC library. Maybe if the motor runs well, I'll create the firmware from scratch? I wanted to save development time.

Schematic is *complete*-ish, I have sent it out to multiple colleagues and online forums to get their feedback on it. I have spent quite a lot of time going back and forth on my component choice; it was a great learning process. I'll update along the process.x

# RVDR V2.0

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-green)

*Completed in 2023 - not to be confused with RVDR+* 

Road Vehicle Data Recorder (RVDR) second revision. It's a smaller version of the first version. Some key changes were made as follows:

- Replace the GNSS module with built-in GPS/GNSS antenna modules using u-blox CAM-M8 series (external antenna is optional).
- Replace multiple sensor ICs with a single TDK ICM-20948 9-Axis MEMS motion tracking (although this is actually a downgrade from the previous 10-DOF sensor).
- Reduced the size to match that of a Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Added an option at the back of the board to choose the communication protocol: UART, SPI or I2C.

# The Kenit Numpad

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-green)

Meet "The Kenit" Numpad (I ran out of ideas about what to name it). This time I experiment with the KiCad "Round Track" plugin. Does it pose any practical benefit? probably not at all, but does it look cool? Definitely! (or I assume to believe).

# 1-ÿ™ŸàÿßŸá/‚ÄéTuah-One

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-green)

1-ÿ™ŸàÿßŸá‚Äé/Tuah-One! A Custom 75% Mechanical Keyboard Project (based on open source schematic)
Months of design and was put into production in April this year. and.... that's it. Chip shortage and the cost of producing such a small quantity is very... very... expensive.

I've tried to arrange the Diode Array in a manner that looks like a traditional Malay carving (ukiran tradisional Melayu). A repeated shape with slight differences but in a repeating arrangement. Yes, it doesn't look much but I tried.

"1-ÿ™ŸàÿßŸá‚Äé/Tuah-one" means "lucky one", well not exactly. With a quick Google translate "tuah" is "good luck", written in Jawi (Malay writing alphabet system before the Latin alphabet came). And also paired with pixelated "art" of "Hang Tuah" (a Laksmana/Admiral in 15th century Melaka; considered by the Malays to be one of history's greatest silat masters [Wikipedia]). Hang Tuah is wearing a traditional Malay headgear called "Tengkolok" or "Tanjak", thus the triangle looks (I tried :P).

*Update - 21/06/2025*

After 3 years from planning to design to fabricating to assembling to testing to actually posting about it, and a sprinkle of procrastination here and there. Here it is Tuah-one/1-ÿ™ŸàÿßŸá! my attempt at "Ukiran Melayu" design-ish. 

Now the keyboard successfully sits inside my office closet (10 months and counting) and never sees sunlight ever again [insert sad noise].
