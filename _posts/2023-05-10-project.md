As an electronic hobbyist, I've had the pleasure of completing some pretty "cool" side projects. It is in reverse chronological order.
# RVDR V2.0
Completed in 2023

Road Vehicle Data Recorder (RVDR) second revision. It's a smaller version of the first version. Some key changes were made as follows:

- Replace the GNSS module with built-in GPS/GNSS antenna modules using u-blox CAM-M8 series (external antenna is optional).
- Replace multiple sensor ICs with a single TDK ICM-20948 9-Axis MEMS motion tracking (although this is actually a downgrade from the previous 10-DOF sensor).
- Reduced the size to match that of a Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Added an option at the back of the board to choose the communication protocol: UART, SPI or I2C.

>There are some things I can do to improve the design like implementing a

>multiple MOSFETs to upscale the signal and free up some space for more 
>sensors. Perhaps this is something I could explore in the third revision.

# The Kenit Numpad
Meet "The Kenit" Numpad (I ran out of ideas about what to name it). This time I experiment with the KiCad "Round Track" plugin. Does it pose any practical benefit? probably not at all, but does it look cool? Definitely! (or I assume to believe).

# 1-تواه/‎Tuah-One
1-تواه‎/Tuah-One! A Custom 75% Mechanical Keyboard Project (based on open source schematic)
Months of design and was put into production in April this year. and.... that's it. Chip shortage and the cost of producing such a small quantity is very... very... expensive.

I've tried to arrange the Diode Array in a manner that it looks like a traditional Malay carving (ukiran tradisional Melayu). A repeated shape with slight difference but in a repeating arrangement. Yes, it doesn't look much but I tried.
