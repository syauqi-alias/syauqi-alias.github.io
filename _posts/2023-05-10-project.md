As an electronic hobbyist, I've had the pleasure of completing some pretty "cool" side projects and university/diploma projects. It is in reverse chronological order.

# Pico-BLDC-Controller

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Development-blue)](https://github.com/your-username/Pi-BLDC-Controller)

As part of my work at Manufacturing Future Lab in University College London, I'm designing a custom hotplate magnetic stirrer to integrate directly into our lab's Opentrons robot.

Since this is my first time designing a motor control, especially a BLDC motor, which uses a half-bridge configuration to control the 3-phase input. 

To be honest, I am quite nervous designing anything more than 5V. The motor we have in the lab to utilise is a [260W 30V/7A Maxon motor](https://www.maxongroup.com/en-gb/search?q=500266)

I utilise a Raspberry Pi microcontroller, namely the new RP2350 dual-core at 150MHz, since the design is much simpler compared to using the STM32 MCU. I have read a lot saying that RP2350 is not at all great for BLDC motor control, especially when reading the current output. It is considered "slow" in converting the ADC value compared to the STM32. But I am planning to open-source the design entirely and may be someone with big brain can utilise the design a write the firmware to overcome this problem. [insert Jimmy Neutron big brain time]

As for the pre-driver, I have chosen [Texas Instrument DRV8350S](https://www.ti.com/product/DRV8353), this IC greatly reduce component count and complexity. No need for me to implement a filtering, snubber or whatnot. Just pre-driver and then the gate (MOSFET). *i'm an idiot engineer wannabe, complex sh*t hurts my brain*

On the software side, I will implement the simpleFOC. Maybe if the motor runs fine, I'll create the firmware from scratch? I wanted to save development time. 

Schematic is *complete*-ish, I have sent it out to multiple colleagues and online forums to get their feedback on it. I have spent quite a lot of time going back and forth on my component choice; it was a great learning process. I'll update along the process.

# RVDR V2.0
*Completed in 2023 - not to be confused with RVDR+* 

Road Vehicle Data Recorder (RVDR) second revision. It's a smaller version of the first version. Some key changes were made as follows:

- Replace the GNSS module with built-in GPS/GNSS antenna modules using u-blox CAM-M8 series (external antenna is optional).
- Replace multiple sensor ICs with a single TDK ICM-20948 9-Axis MEMS motion tracking (although this is actually a downgrade from the previous 10-DOF sensor).
- Reduced the size to match that of a Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Added an option at the back of the board to choose the communication protocol: UART, SPI or I2C.

# The Kenit Numpad
Meet "The Kenit" Numpad (I ran out of ideas about what to name it). This time I experiment with the KiCad "Round Track" plugin. Does it pose any practical benefit? probably not at all, but does it look cool? Definitely! (or I assume to believe).

# 1-ÿ™ŸàÿßŸá/‚ÄéTuah-One
1-ÿ™ŸàÿßŸá‚Äé/Tuah-One! A Custom 75% Mechanical Keyboard Project (based on open source schematic)
Months of design and was put into production in April this year. and.... that's it. Chip shortage and the cost of producing such a small quantity is very... very... expensive.

I've tried to arrange the Diode Array in a manner that looks like a traditional Malay carving (ukiran tradisional Melayu). A repeated shape with slight differences but in a repeating arrangement. Yes, it doesn't look much but I tried.

"1-ÿ™ŸàÿßŸá‚Äé/Tuah-one" means "lucky one", well not exactly. With a quick Google translate "tuah" is "good luck", written in Jawi (Malay writing alphabet system before the Latin alphabet came). And also paired with pixelated "art" of "Hang Tuah" (a Laksmana/Admiral in 15th century Melaka; considered by the Malays to be one of history's greatest silat masters [Wikipedia]). Hang Tuah is wearing a traditional Malay headgear called "Tengkolok" or "Tanjak", thus the triangle looks (I tried :P).

*Update - 21/06/2025*

After 3 years from planning to design to fabricating to assembling to testing to actually posting about it, and a sprinkle of procrastination here and there. Here it is Tuah-one/1-ÿ™ŸàÿßŸá! my attempt at "Ukiran Melayu" design-ish. 

Now the keyboard successfully sits inside my office closet (10 months and counting) and never sees sunlight ever again [insert sad noise].
